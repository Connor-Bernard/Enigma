You may have heard of the Enigma machines that Germany used during World War II to encrypt its military communications. If you have not, I recommend you read the [wikipedia page on them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine), or similar resource, especially the part about design and operation. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2_Q9FoD-oQ) shows what one version of the machine looked like and how it operated. This project involves building a simulator for a generalized version of this machine (which itself had several versions.) Your program will take descriptions of possible initial configurations of the machine and messages to encode or decode (the Enigma algorithms were reciprocal, meaning that encryption is its own inverse operation.)

The Enigmas effect a substitution cipher on the letters of a message. That is, at any given time, the machine performs a permutation—a one-to-one mapping—of the alphabet onto itself. The alphabet consists solely of the 26 letters in one case (there were various conventions for spaces and punctuation).

Plain substitution ciphers are easy to break (you've probably seen puzzles in newspapers that consist of breaking such ciphers). The Enigma, however, implements a progressive substitution, different for each subsequent letter of the message. This made decryption considerably more difficult.

The device consists of a simple mechanical system of (partially) interchangeable rotors (Walzen) that sit side-by-side on a shaft and make electrical contact with each other. Most of these rotors have 26 contacts on both sides, which are wired together internally to effect a permutation of signals coming in from one side onto the contacts on the other (and the inverse permutation when going in the reverse direction). To the left of the rotors, one could select one of a set of reflectors (Umkehrwalzen), with contacts on their right sides only, and wired to connect half of those contacts to the other half. A signal starting from the rightmost rotor enters through one of the 26 possible contacts, flows through wires in the rotors, "bounces" off the reflector, and then comes back through the same rotors (in reverse) by a different route, always ending up being permuted to a letter position different from where it started; that is, the permutation was always a derangement. (This was a significant cryptographic weakness, as it turned out. It doesn't really do a would-be code-breaker any good to know that some letters in an encrypted message might be the same as the those in the plaintext if he doesn't know which ones. But it does a great deal of good to be able to eliminate possible decryptions because some of their letters are the same as in the plaintext.)

Each rotor and each reflector implements a different permutation, and the overall effect depends on their configuration: which rotors and reflector are used, what order they are placed in the machine, and which rotational position they are initially set to. This configuration is the first part of the secret key used to encrypt or decrypt a message. The reflector's permutation was designed to be a derangement, so each letter was mapped to a different letter, which guaranteed that the letter inputted into the enigma machine would be different than the one outputted. In what follows, we'll refer to the selected reflector and rotors in a machine's configuration as 1 through N, with 1 being the reflector, and N the rightmost rotor. In our simulator, N will be a configuration parameter. In actual Enigma machines, it was fixed for any given model (the Kreigsmarine (Navy) used N=5 (four rotors and reflector) and the Wehrmacht used N=4.)

The overall permutation changes with each successive letter because some rotors rotate after encrypting a letter. Each rotor has a circular ratchet on its right side and an "alphabet ring" on its left side that fits over the ratchet of the rotor to its left. Before a letter of a message is translated, a spring-loaded pawl (lever)—one to the right of each rotating rotor—tries to engage the ratchet on the right side of its rotor and thus rotate its rotor by one position, changing the permutation performed by the rotor. Thus, pawls always try to engage with the ratchet of their own rotor. The lever on the rightmost rotor (N) always succeeds, so that rotor N (the "fast" rotor) rotates one position before each character. The pawls pushing the other rotors, however, are normally blocked from engaging their rotors by the alphabet ring on the left side of the rotor to their right. This [interactive website](https://observablehq.com/@tmcw/enigma-machine) provides a good visualization of how signals travel through the rotors and how messages are encrypted. DISCLAIMER: This visualizer does not depict the underlying details of how rotors rotate. It's just a tool that may help your understanding of how the electrical signals propagate through the system.

This ring usually holds the pawl away from its own ratchet, preventing the rotor wheel to its left from moving. However, the rings have notches in them (either one or two in the original Enigma machines), and when the pawl is positioned over a notch in the ring for the rotor to its right, it slips through to its own rotor and pushes it forward. A "feature" of the design called "double stepping" (corrected in other versions of the Enigma, since it reduced the period of the cipher) is that when a pawl is in a notch, it also moves the notch itself and the rotor the notch is connected to. Since the notch for rotor i is connected to rotor i, when the pawl of rotor i−1 slips through into the notch for rotor i, rotors on both sides of the pawl move (so rotor i−1 and rotor i move).

The effect of advancing a wheel is to change where on the wheel any given signal enters or leaves. When a wheel is in its 'A' setting in the machine, then a signal that arrives from the right at, say, the 'C' position, goes into the 'C' contact on the wheel. Likewise, a signal that leaves the wheel from its left 'C' contact exits at the 'C' position. When the wheel is rotated by one to its 'B' setting, a signal that arrives at the 'C' position goes instead into the 'D' contact on the wheel, and a signal that leaves through the 'D' contact does so at the 'C' position. It's easier to calculate if we use numbers 0--25 rather than letters ('A' is 0, 'B' is 1, etc.). Then, when the wheel is in its k setting, a signal entering at the p position enters the p+kmod26 contact on the wheel, and a signal exiting through the c contact does so at the c−kmod26 position. For example, Figure 1 shows one of the rotors from the real Enigma machines (called rotor "I") and the effect of moving from its 'A' to its 'B' setting.

**Figure 1.** Permutations performed by a rotor in its 'A' and 'B' settings. The italicized alphabets at the top and bottom indicate the letters corresponding to the positions around the rotor. The inner alphabets indicate the positions along the rotor itself. The rotor depicted was designated 'I' in the original Enigma machine used by the German military.

Let's illustrate with a much simplified version. Suppose our alphabet has only the letters A-C and we have four rotors (numbered 1-4) each of which has one notch on its ring at the C position. Suppose also that there are 3 pawls, one for each of rotors 2-4. We will still refer to these as pawls 2-4, to maintain that pawl i belongs to rotor i. There is no pawl for rotor 1, which will therefore not rotate. We'll start with the rotors set at AAAA. The next 19 positions are as follows:

    AAAB  AAAC  AABA  AABB  AABC  AACA  ABAB  ABAC
    ABBA  ABBB  ABBC  ABCA  ACAB  ACAC  ACBA  ACBB
    ACBC  ACCA  AAAB
As you can see,

* Rotor 4, the fast rotor, advances each time, pushed by pawl 4. Rotor 4 has no rotor to its right, so there isn't a ring blocking it from engaging with its ratchet.
* Rotor 3 advances whenever Rotor 4 is at C. Rotor 4 has a notch at C, so pawl 3 can engage with the corresponding ratchet (the ratchet belonging to Rotor 3) and advance Rotor 3 by pushing on its ratchet. This would also rotate Rotor 4, since pawl 3 contacts its ratchet through the notch of Rotor 4, and therefore pushes the side of the notch when it moves. However, since Rotor 4 always rotates anyway (because pawl 4 is always unblocked), this doesn't really change anything.
* Rotor 2 advances whenever Rotor 3 is at C, pushed by pawl 2. Rotor 3 has a notch at C, so pawl 2 slips into the notch and engages with its ratchet (the ratchet belonging to Rotor 2). Rotor 3 also advances when it is at C, because when pawl 2 is engaged through Rotor 3's notch it will push against that notch when it moves, moving Rotor 3, as well as moving Rotor 2 by pushing on Rotor 2's ratchet.
* Since there is no pawl 1, double-stepping does not occur, so Rotor 2 (unlike Rotor 3) does not advance just because it is at C.
* Rotor 1 never changes, since there is no pawl on either side of it.
Each rotor can only advance at most one position per keypress.

So the advancement of the rotors, while similar to that of the wheels of an odometer, is not quite the same. If it were, then the next position after AACA would be AACB, rather than ABAB. Also, it would take 27 steps to return to the initial configuration instead of 18.

The contacts on the rightmost rotor's right side connect with stationary input and output contacts, which run to keys that, when pressed, direct current to the contact from a battery or, when not pressed, direct current back from the contact to a light bulb indicating a letter of the alphabet. Since a letter never encrypts or decrypts to itself after going back and forth through the rotors, the to and from directions never conflict.

The German Navy used a machine with 12 rotors and five slots for them:

* Eight rotors labeled with roman numerals I--VIII, of which three will be used in any given configuration as the rightmost rotors,
* Two additional non-moving rotors (Zusatzwalzen) labeled "Beta" and "Gamma", of which one will be used in any configuration, as the fourth-from-right rotor, and
* Two reflectors (Umkehrwalzen), labeled 'B' and 'C', of which one will be used in any given configuration as the leftmost rotor.
Given just this equipment, there are 614,175,744 possible configurations (or keys):

* Two possible reflectors, times
* Two possible rotors in the fourth position, times
* 8!/(8−3)!=336 choices for the rightmost three rotors and their ordering, times
* 26<sup>4</sup> possible initial rotational settings for the rightmost four rotors (each reflector had only one possible position).

Especially by today's standards, this is not a large key size (less than 30 bits). To make things more difficult for code-breakers, therefore, the Enigma incorporated a plugboard (Steckerbrett) between the keyboard and the rightmost wheel. It acted as a non-moving, configurable rotor. The operator could choose any set of disjoint pairs of letters by means of cables placed between them on the plugboard. Each selected pair would then be swapped going into the machine from the keyboard and coming out into the indicator lights. Thus, if the operator connected ("steckered") the letters A and P, then P would be substituted for each A typed and vice versa. Likewise, if an ingoing letter was encrypted to P by the other rotors, it would display as A, and letters decrypted as A would display as P.
